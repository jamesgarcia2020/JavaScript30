# Notes on the JS

## This is the first of the 30 daily Javascript projects I am working on.

### This first project took me two days or around 2 hours to complete. The video that Wes Bos created to build this app was just under 20 minutes in total time.

### I had issues with getting seom of the console.logs to appear in the Chrome broswer console. I checked the errors in Google and found some articles in Stack OverFlow. None of the suggested I found worked or I couldn't figure out how to implement them

### The final code was not working because I misspelled the word transitionend with transitioned. This mistake cause me to watch the video a second time and spend another hour and a half trouble shooting the error. I looked at the finished code to compare it to my code. The finished code looked different than the code Wes wrote in the video. Before I found the mistake in my code, which was nearly the last line of code, I made all of the changes that were shown in the finished code.

### Overall this project showed me the pains of writing in Javascript. I probably don't quite understand every reason he gave for writing the code as he did. But overall I am happy with the project working and that the project was a mini drum kit. I enjoy banging on a good drum set and an electonric one is pretty cool too. This is a completed project I can see myself using.
